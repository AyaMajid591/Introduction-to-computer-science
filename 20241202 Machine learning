Today we learned about Machine learning and optimization
Machine learning- is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. ML systems can analyze large amounts of data to find patterns and make predictions. 
What it's used for
Personalization: ML can analyze user behavior and preferences to suggest content 
Data analysis: ML can analyze large datasets to identify patterns and trends 
Fraud detection: ML can identify patterns in known data to predict if a new transaction is fraudulent
